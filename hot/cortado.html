    <h2 style="text-align:center;">About</h2>
    <p><span style="font-family: 'Nunito';">
      A cortado is a drink made with equal parts milk and espresso. Cortados are served with a double shot of espresso and 2 ounces of milk. In Spanish, the word “cortado” means “cut.” This refers to the milk “cutting through” the espresso. The milk in a cortado is thinner and very lightly textured, similar to that of a latte rather than a cappuccino. This drink is also known as a gibraltar—this refers to a small glass cup that many use to serve cortados. Most espresso-based drinks come from traditional Italian drinks but cortados are one of the only mainstream espresso drinks that are Spanish in origin.

    <h2 style="text-align:center;">Recipe</h2>

    <h3 style="text-align:center;">Ingredients</h3>

    <ul style="text-align:center;">
    <li>2 shots espresso</li>
    <li>2 ounces milk</li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <h3 style="text-align:center;">Instructions</h3>
    <ol style="text-align:center;">
    <li>Pull 2 shots of espresso. Grind coffee beans and use an espresso machine to extract 2 shots of espresso into a small cup that holds at least 4 ounces. A gibraltar glass is the perfect size for a cortado at 4.5 ounces.</li>
    <li>Steam milk. Froth 4 ounces of lightly textured milk (the same as you would for a latte)—but you’ll only use 2 since steaming less than 4 ounces is difficult without burning it.</li>
    <li>Pour milk into espresso. Into your cup with espresso, pour in 2 ounces of milk. </li>
    </ol>
