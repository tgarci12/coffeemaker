    <br>

    <h2 style="text-align:center;">About</h2>
    <p><span style="font-family: 'Nunito';">
      A cappuccino is an espresso drink with steamed milk, milk foam and espresso. It’s very similar to a latte (cafe latte), but the proportion of steamed milk is different. Here’s the breakdown of a latte vs cappuccino: A cappuccino has equal parts espresso, steamed milk and foam (⅓ each). A latte is ⅓ espresso and 2/3 steamed milk, with a thin layer of foam on top. Here’s a chart that breaks it down!

      The differences between the two drinks are pretty subtle, and so is the flavor. But you’re in luck: the cappuccino is the easier of the two to perfect at home. With a latte you’re looking for microfoam, steamed milk with a wet-paint like texture that’s almost impossible to get without an espresso machine. A cappuccino can easily be made with frothed milk using various tools: even a whisk!

    <h2 style="text-align:center;">Recipe</h2>
    <h3 style="text-align:center;">Ingredients</h3>
    <ul style="text-align:center;">
    <li>2 espresso shots (2 ounces)</li>
    <li>4 ounces (½ cup) fresh whole milk</li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <h3 style="text-align:center;">Instructions</h3>
    <ol style="text-align:center;">
    <li>Make the espresso: Use an espresso machine or manual espresso maker to make two shots of espresso and pour it into a mug.</li>
    <li>Steaming method (espresso machine): Place the milk in a pitcher. Hold the steaming wand just below the surface of the milk until it doubles in size and is very foamy. Lower the steaming wand slightly until the milk reaches 150 degrees Fahrenheit (use a thermometer or judge by when your hand can’t hold the pitcher for more than a few seconds).</li>
    <li>OR, heat the milk to scalding and foam it (without espresso machine): Heat the milk to 150 degrees Fahrenheit, which is hot to the touch but not simmering. Measure with a food thermometer, or you can approximate by testing with your finger. Use a milk frother, French press or whisk to froth the milk until it’s very foamy. For a cappuccino you’ll want a good amount of froth: you’re going for ⅓ espresso, ⅓ steamed milk and ⅓ foam. We highly recommend reading How to Froth Milk if this is your first time frothing. For the French press method, note that it’s useful to have at least 1 cup to have more milk to work with: this makes enough for 2 drinks.</li>
    <li>Serve: Swirl the milk container a few times. Pour milk and foam into center of the espresso.</li>
