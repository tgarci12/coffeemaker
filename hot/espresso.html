    <h1 style="text-align:center;">ESPRESSO</h1>
    <br>

    <h2 style="text-align:center;">About</h2>
    <p><span style="font-family: 'Nunito';">
      Contrary to popular belief, there’s many different ways to be an espresso fan — you don’t have to invest in a luxury manual machine and master the art of dialing in the perfect shot. You can try out an automatic or capsule espresso machine, Nespresso machine, or you can even make espresso-like coffee with stovetop makers and other methods. But whichever kind of home barista you’re looking to become, you’ll need to learn the basics of espresso and how to operate the machine of your choice.

    <h2 style="text-align:center;">Recipe</h2>

    <h3 style="text-align:center;">Ingredients</h3>

    <ul style="text-align:center;">
    <li>Coffee beans</li>
    <li>Good coffee grinder</li>
    <li>Milk frother</li>
    <li>Kitchen scale</li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <h3 style="text-align:center;">Instructions</h3>
    <ol style="text-align:center;">
    <li>Grind and measure your beans. Using dark roast coffee beans and a quality grinder, grind enough beans to make one or two espresso shots. An average single espresso shot will require between 6 and 8 grams of coffee grounds, although this can be adjusted up or down. For a double shot, about 15 grams. Your grounds should be powdery and fine, so go ahead and use the finest setting on your grinder. If you want to be sure you measured correctly, you can weigh your grounds on a kitchen scale — just make sure to tare out the portafilter first.</li>
    <li>Distribute and tamp down your shot. Once you have an amount of grounds in your portafilter that you’re happy with, distribute the grounds evenly with a finger, place the portafilter on the countertop or other flat surface, and then use the tamper to tamp down on the grounds. You’ll then have a compact disk of espresso in the portafilter.</li>
    <li>Pull your shot. Before you start, run the machine briefly without a portafilter in place to clear the ground head. Then, lock the portafilter into the machine, position your demitasse glass or other vessel underneath, and start your shot. The espresso should be ready after 25 to 30 seconds, but it will take practice with your specific machine and lots of taste tests to achieve shots to your liking. (Some machines require you to time it manually, while others offer different settings.) The final product shouldn’t be too light or dark in color, shouldn’t taste too acidic or too bitter, and should have a fine layer of caramel-colored crema on top.
    </li>
    <li>Prepare milk if using and enjoy your espresso. If you’re trying to make a latte or other drink with milk, you’ll then need to steam your milk (we’ve included step-by-step milk steaming instructions in our latte how-to). If not, enjoy your espresso as is! Make sure to clean and dry the portafilter, as well as purge and wipe down the milk frothing wand, when you’re done.</li>
