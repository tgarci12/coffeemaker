    <h2 style="text-align:center;">About</h2>
    <p><span style="font-family: 'Nunito';">
      Portugal doesn’t grow coffee, but the drink is still very important to the culture. Portuguese coffee typically uses a blend of Arabica and Robusta (instead of the all-Arabica preference of many other countries). The beans are roasted more slowly, producing a creamier, low-acid coffee that has a thicker mouthfeel. That “thickness” is why many people in Portugal ask for a glass of water alongside their coffee — to wash it down!

      Like most of Europe, Portuguese coffee lovers largely drink espresso, not brewed coffee. That’s where the Galao comes in: the Portuguese version of a latte! Often served with pastel de nata, a Portuguese custard tart, the Galao is made with espresso and steamed milk.

      A Portuguese Galao is something like a latte, with one part espresso and three parts hot milk. It comes together in just a few minutes and makes a tasty caffeinated treat!
