    <h2 style="text-align:center;">About</h2>
    <p><span style="font-family: 'Nunito';">
      A lungo is a shot of espresso made with more water. It’s a bigger drink than a regular espresso shot because more water runs through the ground coffee, making it slightly diluted. “Lungo” translates to “long” in Italian, as in pulling a long shot. A short shot is called a ristretto. A regular shot (not long or short), is just called espresso. A lungo shot isn’t as intense as an espresso and it usually has a distinct bitterness at the end of the shot, which comes from the water being allowed to run through the espresso for a longer period of time. Regular espresso shots are usually an ounce, while a lungo shot can be anywhere between 1 ½ ounces to 2 ounces.

    <li>Level and tamp filled portafilter. Clean loose ground coffee off the portafilter.</li>
