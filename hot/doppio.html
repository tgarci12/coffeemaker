    <h2 style="text-align:center;">About</h2>
    <p><span style="font-family: 'Nunito';">
      Let’s step back into European history to get a better idea of why the Doppio is still one of the most beloved espresso-based drinks that gives a nice little kick. The name itself is derived from Latin and is a combined version of three combined Latin words. This includes Dous, Plus, and Pleo which create the word “Duplus”. When this was translated into Italian, the rough word that came from this became Doppio. Pronounced “DOH-pee-oh,” the word just means “double” in Italian.

      Since the Italians were masters at the culinary craft of roasting and combining espresso beans, they would call each shot that was extracted from their crude espresso machines either a solo or Un Café which is also a single shot of espresso. Since a solo and doppio were synonymous with a single or double shot of espresso, they really didn’t need much attention when being served as a specific drink concoction.

      Those who order a single or double-shot would then add sugar or cream to their espresso and enjoy it as soon as it was served. Unlike other drink recipes, a doppio is very simple to make since it’s just a double shot of espresso that is twice the amount of espresso that you would normally get at the café where it was ordered.

    <h2 style="text-align:center;">Recipe</h2>

    <h3 style="text-align:center;">Ingredients</h3>

    <ul style="text-align:center;">
    <li>2 shots espresso</li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <h3 style="text-align:center;">Instructions</h3>
    <ol style="text-align:center;">
    <li>You first need to grind your espresso to a consistency that is going to filter through your machine. This should be a fine grind that gives you a powdery result rather than a medium-course grind that is used for Aeropress, Chemex, or other types of coffee pots that require an over-the-top pout method. The use of water pressure is essential to create the best-tasting result by being forced out of your machine.</li>
    <li>Make two separate amounts that will fit into your portafilter and tamp the contents so they are lightly packed. The rest of the work comes from waiting for your espresso to be extracted. After this is complete you add a new batch of espresso into the portafilter and repeat the same extraction.</li>
    <li>If you have a hand pump espresso maker, you’ll need to use several repeated pumps to build up pressure. This not only allows the pressure to build while the espresso is filtering, but it adds a richer crema that gives espresso more character. This technique is what Érik Favre did who traveled through Italy to learn the secrets of what makes espresso taste superior. His hard work and attention to detail (with a little motivation from his Italian wife), led to the invention of the Nespresso machine.</li>
    <li>When you’re done you simply add sugar or milk to your doppio and then drink right away.</li>
