    <h2 style="text-align:center;">About</h2>
    <p><span style="font-family: 'Nunito';">
      Black coffee is simply coffee that is normally brewed without the addition of additives such as sugar, milk, cream, or added flavors. While it has a slightly bitter taste compared to when it is flavored with additives, many people love a strong cup of black coffee. In fact, for some, it is part of their everyday diet.

      If you are looking for a drink that is low in calories, fats, and carbohydrates, then black coffee is the perfect drink for you. Simply put, drinking coffee only becomes a cause for concern when you drink it regularly with milk, sugar, cream, etc. With these additives, even a single cup of coffee can contain as many calories as an extra-large slice of cake.

    <h2 style="text-align:center;">Recipe</h2>
    <h3 style="text-align:center;">Ingredients</h3>
    <ul style="text-align:center;">
    <li>2 Tbsp group coffee or 1 K-Cup</li>
    <li>8 ounces boiling water</li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <h3 style="text-align:center;">Instructions</h3>
    <ol style="text-align:center;">
    <li>Before making black coffee, check if your machine requires filters. If it does, the manual for your coffee maker will give specific instructions for placing the filter into the machine. Usually it goes into a cone-shaped area.</li>
    <li>Insert the coffee into your French Press, pourover carafe or coffee machine. If using a Keurig, place the K-Cup inside the K-Cup insert and close the lid.</li>
    <li>Add 8 ounces of water into the machine and press start. If using a French Press or pourover carafe, pour gently and evenly over the grounds and wait 5 minutes before pressing (for French Press) or removing the carafe (for pourover).</li>
    </ol>
