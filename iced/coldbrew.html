    <h2 style="text-align:center;">About</h2>
    <p><span style="font-family: 'Nunito';">
      If you crave a good iced coffee in the summer, but loathe the way so many end up tasting watery or overly bitter, then there's only one solution: cold brew coffee. This method guarantees a smooth and icy cup, every time.

      Making cold brew coffee is no great secret, nor does it require the ninja-level skills of a trained barista in order to master. You don't even need much special equipment beyond a large container for making the coffee and a strainer.

    <h2 style="text-align:center;">Recipe</h2>

    <h3 style="text-align:center;">Ingredients</h3>

    <ul style="text-align:center;">
    <li>1 cup (113 grams) whole coffee beans</li>
    <li>4 cups (907 grams) water</li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <h3 style="text-align:center;">Instructions</h3>
    <ol style="text-align:center;">
    <li>Coarsely grind the coffee: Grind the coffee beans on the coarsest setting on your grinder, or in short 1-second pulses in a spice grinder. The grounds should look like coarse cornmeal, not fine powder. You should have just under 1 cup of grounds.</li>
    <li>Combine the coffee and the water: Transfer the coffee grounds to the container you're using to make the cold brew. Pour the water over top. Stir gently with a long-handled spoon to make sure the grounds are thoroughly saturated with water.</li>
    <li>Steep overnight: Cover the jar with a lid or a small plate to protect it from dust and bugs. Let the coffee steep for about 12 hours. The coffee can be left on the counter or refrigerated; steeping time is the same.</li>
    <li>Strain the coffee: Line a small strainer with cheesecloth or flour sack cloth and place over a large measuring cup or bowl. Pour the coffee through the strainer.</li>
    <li>Store the coffee: Transfer the coffee to a small bottle or jar and store in the fridge for up to a week.</li>
    <li>Serve the coffee: Dilute the coffee with as much water or milk as you prefer. Serve over ice or warm for a few minutes in the microwave.</li>
    </ol>
