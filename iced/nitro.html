    <h2 style="text-align:center;">About</h2>
    <p><span style="font-family: 'Nunito';">
      Let’s dispel a common misconception right away: nitro coffee is not super caffeinated or even more caffeinated than coffee!

      The “nitro” refers to nitrogen, and nitro coffee is any coffee that has been infused with nitrogen gas. Nitrogen naturally tastes sweet, and the bubbles are significantly smaller than carbon dioxide bubbles. In fact, they’re so little, you’ll perceive them more as a cream than as carbonation.

      The result of pumping nitrogen into coffee is a rich, creamy, delicately sweet, and utterly smooth taste and mouthfeel. It’s an exciting coffee experience, and because those who make nitro coffee typically use cold brew coffee as a base — which is naturally smooth and tastes less acidic than hot brewed coffee — nitro cold brew is extraordinarily refreshing and enjoyable.

    <h2 style="text-align:center;">Recipe</h2>

    <h3 style="text-align:center;">Ingredients</h3>

    <ul style="text-align:center;">
    <li>Coarsely ground coffee</li>
    <li>4 cups fresh, cold water</li>
    <li>4 ounces of coarsely ground coffee</li>
    <li>Cold brew flavoring (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <h3 style="text-align:center;">Instructions</h3>
    <ol style="text-align:center;">
    <li>Mix coffee grounds and water into a large mason jar or carafe. Stir to ensure all coffee grounds come in contact with water. Let sit for 18-24 hours at room temperature.</li>
    <li>Place your fine sieve on top of an empty, clean mason jar or carafe, and pour the contents of your coffee and water mixture into it through the sieve. Dispose of any caught grounds.</li>
    <li>Rinse the carafe or mason jar you just emptied, and place a pour-over cone and filter on top. Pour the new coffee mixture into the clean container through the paper filter to remove any of the smaller grounds. Depending on the amount of coffee grounds being filtered out, you may need to swap to a second paper filter to improve the flow of filtered coffee. Dispose of the used filter(s).</li>
    <li>Place your fully filtered cold brew in the fridge and let it sit until it reaches your desired drinking temperature.</li>
    <li>Open your cream whipper and fill with cold brew. Load a nitrogen cartridge into the whipper, and close and tighten the lid.

    Shake the whipper lightly, flip upside down, and pull the trigger as briefly as possible into a serving glass to “burp” the gas out of the whipper. Repeat 2-3 times to avoid spraying highly pressurized coffee everywhere.

    When there is no longer a risk of making a mess, pull and hold the trigger to dispense nitrogen-infused coffee into your glass.</li>
    <li>Enjoy your velvety nitro coffee!</li>
